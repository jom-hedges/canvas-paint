# A Clone of a 90s classic

A video game where the player must capture parts of a rectangular space by dividing it with horizontal or vertical lines. While each line is being drawn it must not be touched by bouncing balls, sometimes referred to as <i>atoms</i>.

The game starts with two atoms bouncing around a room (the rectangular grid of play). 

The game is controlled by using a mouse. Right click alternates between horizontal and vertical orientation, whereas a left click starts the wall building. If a ball collides with a wall while its building then the wall stops at that point and the player loses a life. The player must capture at least 75% of the room's surface area.

The player begins each level with the same number of lives as there are atoms in that level. The game finishes if all lives are lost. There are an infinite number of levels, but from level 49 every level starts with 50 atoms.
